Predict Genetic Engineering Attribution 

Genetic engineering attribution is the process of identifying the source of a genetically engineered piece of DNA. Reducing anonymity can encourage more responsible behavior within scientific and entrepreneurial communities, without stifling innovation. The objective of this competition is to predict the laboratory of origin for plasmid DNA sequences.
